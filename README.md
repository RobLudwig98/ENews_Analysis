# ENews_Analysis
A data science project to optimize E-News Express landing page using A/B testing. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization with Python. Key insights reveal improved user engagement and conversion rates, guiding strategic design improvements for enhanced user experience.
This repository contains my data analysis project for an advanced data science course, focused on optimizing the landing page of E-News Express. The project includes A/B testing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover insights into user behavior and engagement.
Key Features

    A/B Testing Framework: Evaluate the performance of the old vs. new landing page designs.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand user interaction patterns and behaviors.
    Hypothesis Testing: Statistically validate the effectiveness of the new landing page design.
    Interactive Visualizations: Reveal user engagement metrics and conversion rates.

Skills Showcased

    Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    A/B Testing and Statistical Analysis
    Data Visualization
    Hypothesis Testing
    Version Control: Git and GitHub

Findings from this project were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation, also available in this repository, demonstrating the application of data analysis to real-world business challenges in the digital marketing industry.
Project Overview
Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned landing page in increasing user engagement and conversion rates for E-News Express. The goal is to determine if the new landing page design can better capture user interest compared to the existing design.
Objectives

    Assess if the new landing page retains users for longer durations compared to the old version.
    Measure the improvement in conversion rates with the new landing page.
    Investigate how language preference influences conversion rates and user engagement on the new page.

Project Description

This project involves an A/B testing framework to empirically evaluate the performance of old and new landing page designs. Key activities include:

    Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior on both landing pages.
    Performing hypothesis tests to statistically validate the effectiveness of the new design.
    Analyzing user engagement metrics, such as time spent on the page and conversion status, segmented by language preference.

Metrics Evaluated

    Time Spent on the Page: The duration users spend on either the old or new landing page.
    Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., subscribe) on the landing page.
    Language Preference: The preferred language of users and its potential impact on engagement and conversion rates.

Evaluations Conducted

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand distribution, central tendencies, and relationships between variables.
    Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables such as time spent on the page, group distribution, and language preference.
    Bivariate Analysis: Comparing the relationship between different variables, such as landing page type versus time spent on the page and conversion status versus time spent on the page.
    Hypothesis Testing:
        Testing if there is a significant difference in median time spent on the new versus old landing page.
        Testing if conversion rates are significantly higher on the new landing page.
        Testing if language preference significantly influences conversion rates and engagement times.

Key Findings

    Engagement: The new landing page significantly increased user engagement and conversion rates.
    Language Impact: Language preference did not significantly affect conversion rates, indicating the new design is universally engaging across different languages.
    User Interaction: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the time users spent on the new landing page, with a lower standard deviation indicating more consistent engagement.

Recommendations

    Implement the new landing page design across the platform.
    Continue offering multiple language options without change.
    Regularly iterate and optimize the landing page through ongoing A/B testing.
